% createNet
% Simple utility to cut a "net" of background values into a digital surface model
%
% Syntax
%   [ZInet isNetCell] = createNet(ZI,cellSize,netWidth)
%
%
% Description
%   createNet removes columns and rows from ZI according to the spacing
%   specified in gridSpacing, which is a spacing specified according to
%   map coordinates (not necessarily pixels).  These columns and rows are
%   refilled according to background values calculated from an image
%   opening operation with a disk-shaped structuring element with a radius
%   twice the size of netWidth.  Cutting in a net into a DSM helps to keep
%   the size of the filter window to a manageable size.  A net is typically
%   useful when the buildings can not be entirely removed with a 20 meter
%   window radius.
%
%
% Requirements
%   Image Processing Toolbox
%
%
% Input Parameters
%   ZI           - A two dimensional image
%
%   cellSize     - The spacing (in map units) between cells
%
%   netWidth     - The size (in map units) for the net
%
%
% Output Parameters
%
%   ZInet        - ZI, with the net cut in 
%
%   isNetCell    - A logical image mask of the net
